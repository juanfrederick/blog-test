# Blog Test

Hello everyone this is a simple Blog Website. I made it using React JS and Tailwind CSS. This Web i made for learning consuming API in React JS.

Don't forget to

```bash
  npm install
```

To download the modules needed

```bash
  npm run server
  npm run dev
```

To run the server and website.

If the server won't run, u can install json server globally by:

```bash
  npm install -g json-server
```

Thank You :D.
